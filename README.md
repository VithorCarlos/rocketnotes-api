The system offers several functionalities that allow the user to register, update and filter notes, link useful links, create tags, with each tag being associated with a specific note.

### !Important!
*I was studying some concepts, and I did this project with pure javascript, but soon it will be refactored to typescript, I will put more tests, and leave the entire structure in SOLID*

## How to start the project?

1 - Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies...

2 - Insert the `AUTH_SECRET` and `PORT` in the `.env` file
  - AUTH_SECRET is the unique key to generate the JWT Token
